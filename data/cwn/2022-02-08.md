## pyml_bindgen: a CLI app to generate Python bindings directly from OCaml value specifications

### Ryan Moore announced

#### New version

I wanted to announce a new version of `pyml_bindgen` has been merged into the opam repository, version 0.2.0. Whenever it hits, feel free to try it out!

The main addition is now you can embed Python files directly into the generated OCaml module and it will be evaluated at run time. In this way, you don't need your users to mess with the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or need them to install a particular Python module when using the generated OCaml code. (Another thanks to UnixJunkie and Thierry Martinez for their help with this!)

There were also a few bugfixes and some nice new [examples](https://github.com/mooreryan/ocaml_python_bindgen/tree/main/examples) added to the GitHub repository. One cool thing about the examples is that they show you how to set up your project to use Dune rules to automatically generate Python bindings whenever the value specification files change!
